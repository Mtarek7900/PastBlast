                    GOATY IS FINALLY 20!!!!!
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Masha'Allah you out of the teen yearssss. I still remember the paragraph you sent 
                    me on my Birthday and I loved it so much, so Ofcourse I gotta repay that favor. Happy Birthday my sweet, 
                    beautiful, caring, funny, and best of all,  my Muslim goaty!!! This past year that I've gotten to know you 
                    was one hell of a year lol. Do I regret it? Not a single bit. When I met you you seemed cheery, but We both 
                    know how much sadness you had in you. Still remember that deals encounter perfectly when we both can say it's 
                    when we first truly met. It took its time but you finally was able to surpass that sadness and even hatred for 
                    the fag and you have become one of the best Muslims I have ever met. We have talked almost everyday this past 
                    year and I can't wait for more talks in the long run In Shaa Allah. There were some bumpy moments at times, but 
                    we made it Alhamdulillah. Like I said before , even though it's been only a year, it feels like I have known you 
                    for a decade , you are my closest friend afterall. It's only been a year now , but knowing how fast time moves, 
                    watch it be 5-10 years already and In Shaa Allah we will remain such good friends. Hope to see you soon In Shaa 
                    Allah, want to see my favorite 20 year old goaty! I wish the best for you and you always in my duas. Even though 
                    you might seem lost, just remember Allah put you in a situation that is the best for you at the time and there's 
                    always Blessings behind it. Even then, if you ever seem lost or just want anyone to even just to talk to, I'll 
                    always be for you. You are you and I love you, for the sake of Allah and for the person that you are. You the best, 
                    Happy Birthday Yasmin!!!! 🐐✨💙🌙

                <p>
                    I feel like you expected this and I’m pretty sure I’m not the only person 
                    who sent something but I’m not gonna do a huge long ass paragraph, making this short and sweet hopefully lol. We had lots 
                    of rough times over the years and many struggles went by but Alhamdulillah things worked out. I know rn this ain’t such 
                    a great time with all the problems that had befallen you all over but Dude you are such a strong person for being able 
                    to be grateful. I know how much you struggle yet try, I see you break down at points and it something that is truly 
                    difficult to watch sometimes, but I do hope In Shaa Allah that Allah is setting up something beautiful for you In Shaa 
                    Allah. You’re the person I care about the most right and I know I haven’t always been there for you like I had promised, 
                    but I do hope that I can be of a help to you whenever you ask. In Shaa Allah I will never turn away from you if you ever 
                    need help from me. Masha’Allah for being 21, Allah will reward you for all your patience and hard work, Even in the 
                    darkest of times, Allah’s noor will still reach you and bring forth unimaginable blessings In Shaa Allah. I can make this 
                    longer but wouldn’t want to you feel overwhelmed, so I’ll just leave it here lol, if anything I’ll say more In person later, 
                    but remember Allah is always gonna take care of you and will definitely show you a way when everything seems bleak. Anyways, 
                    Happy Birthday Yasmin and even though you got lots of problems are ahead of you, may there be tons of Baraqah In Shaa Allah 🎂🌙

                    I know this has been a pretty difficult year for you but Alhamdulillah 
                    your strength and patience has made you through 😌. I don’t want to be too annoying, especially when many people are probably gonna do 
                    this but hopefully I can make it count lol. I’m sorry for all the pain I caused you this year, we had our fights and they were pretty bad, 
                    but Alhamdulillah we had many good times. My favorite was in Eid and I saw you when I gave you the goat . You had this smile that made that 
                    walk in heat completely worth it lmaooooo. What I am getting at is that despite the arguments we had, you are such an amazing person, one of 
                    the most I have ever met, if not the best. Masha’Allah you have become such a great Muslim even if you don’t see it, but trust me, you have 
                    made it a long way. I’m grateful that you’re still my friend man, I really am. I may seem uncaring at times, but seriously you are someone very 
                    important to my life. I know you struggle so much and I barely am able to help you and my words don’t mean much, but may Allah truly bless you 
                    for all you go through and all the people you help, despite all the BS you go through. In Shaa Allah May you have a beautiful day today and I 
                    hope I didn’t cringe you too hard throughout this, I would keep on rambling but I’ll save you the trouble of reading through my incoherent 
                    speech lmao. Again I’m sorry for being an incompetent friend but In Shaa Allah I can be a better person as well, but rn I open for the best 
                    for you and may you be able to find peace.  Happy Birthday goaty!!! 🥰 🐐

                <p>
                    Was hoping to do it a minute before 12 but gonna have to lead prayer so I might to miss the 12 mark, so EARLIER THE BETTER 😀. I’m sorry for 
                    not saying much this past while, was just sulking and have been overwhelmed with many things at home, but obviously I needed to do this 😁😁😁. 
                    I know you’ve been struggling a lot and things have been very grim with school, at home, future, etc, but In Shaa Allah this will all lead to a 
                    path that will bring you to greatness. I wanted to give you a gift this year, was thinking of making some origami like old times sake but Ofcourse 
                    the quarantine 😔, In Shaa Allah though I’ll make it up somehow. I know you also got lots of stuff due in the following day, but once you finish a 
                    big portion of it, RELAX AND ENJOY YOURSELF! (Halal of course 😂). I know I am blabbering and probably don’t make any sense, but imma continue just 
                    a bit because I’ve been slacking lmaooo, Yasmin remember no matter how many years have past, you’ve always improved in becoming a better Muslim then 
                    before, and that really is special and amazing because you were such a great Muslim for a very long time now. Allah will always keep you on the right 
                    path and even when things hit their low points, it will spring you right on top again In Shaa Allah. Now that it is Ramadan, be sure to get lots of 
                    rewards even the smallest things are multiplied 70 times. Before I write an essay and kill your brain cells from my atrocious grammer, I’ll just leave 
                    it there lol, AGAIN HAPPY BIRTHDAY AND STAY AMAZING, sorry for always being a bumass loser 😭🎂

                     MY BEAUTIFUL PARTNER IN CRIME!!!! I know you've been having a rough time lately, but hopefully today 
                    is a day you can get some rest and have a good time. This year has been rough, eventful, and tiresome, but Masha’Allah you came out stronger 
                    than ever. You have been through so much, you've been more hurt compared to most people I know, but I believe that the trials you face will bring 
                    you even closer to Jannah In Shaa Allah. Regardless of all the bad that's happened to you, always remember the good that you do. You've always been 
                    understanding and caring, always tried to stay true to yourself, and keep on improving, even when your mind and body is failing you. You are amazing 
                    and your efforts and intentions will be accounted for. I know I sound like a broken parrot, but I truly believe that you are one of the best people I 
                    know, and even just for religious reasons. Unfortunately people keep weighing you down, but you keep looking forward and I really respect that about 
                    you. I hope I am able to help you more and In Shaa Allah if you ever need anything I am here for you, just say the word. Not gonna write a whole essay 
                    because I don't want you to knock out lmao but I hope this year will be an opposite of last year and will be filled with Baraqah all over In Shaa Allah! 
                    STAY AMAZING YOU GOT THISSSSSSSS!!!! Also hope im first LOL

                        and annoy you so much, but it’s because I care about you so much and want you to laugh and be happy. I know you’ve been going through a lot and 
                        you don’t usually have a great time during your birthday but I hope you can atleast have a great start In Shaa Allah. Remember to take care of
